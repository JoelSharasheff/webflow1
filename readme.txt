These are files initially generated in the Webflow editor by Troy Douglas. 
This is a proof of concept to see that we can quickly and efficiently create the basics for 
a nice looking TSSG website together. 
The html/css/javascript files can then be exported from the Webflow editor and edited by 
programmers in their chosen development environments to continue the development of the 
website.
The javascript code was initially exported from the Webflow editor as minified.
/js/webflow.js is an un-minified version. The original is stored in the root directory for 
future comparison.
And /css/tssg.webflow.css was renamed to /css/tssgWebflow.css.
Edits to CSS and HTML should be fairly standard.
Edits to the javascript may be harder to work with. Hopefully, few changes are necessary.
One suggestion for javascript changes is to export new code and cut and paste what we need 
from that.
